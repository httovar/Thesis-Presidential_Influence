(STARZ) A DANGEROUS METHOD (2011) A disturbed young Russian, Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), is brought to a clinic in Zurich in the early 20th century, and a doctor named Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender, above with Ms. Knightley) performs a new treatment called psychoanalysis to help her. Soon she becomes his lover and finally a colleague. But as emotionally connected as Sabina is to Jung, it is with his mentor, Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen), that she finds a more cerebral affinity. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called this film from David Cronenberg, based on a play by its screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, and drawn from a book by John Kerr, a “subtle and intellectually thrilling true story.” The movie “is full of ideas about sexuality — some quite provocative, even a century after their first articulation — but it also recognizes and communicates the erotic power of ideas,” he said. “There are scenes of kinky activity between Sabina and Jung that will no doubt enjoy long life in specialized corners of the Internet, but the most unsettling aspect of ‘A Dangerous Method’ may be the links it suggests between sex and thinking. The mind is both slave and master of the body’s appetites, and the absurd and terrifying task of stabilizing that dynamic, in theory and in practice, is embraced equally by the film and the fragile, serious historical figures who inhabit it.” ",The New York Times,2013-07-01T04:19:04+0000,article,Culture,Arts,Television,Schedule,nyt://article/aaf3b218-c5dd-52a6-a2b1-99ca2ebc2ddc,763,nyt://article/aaf3b218-c5dd-52a6-a2b1-99ca2ebc2ddc,NA,What’s on Monday,NA,NA,What’s On Monday,NA,NA,NA,By Adam W.

(Sundance) RAN (1985) In his masterwork inspired by Shakespeare’s “King Lear,” the Japanese director Akira Kurosawa tells the story of Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai), an exhausted 70-year-old warlord who wants to turn the vast dominion acquired through 50 years of bloodshed over to his three sons, on whose kindness he will then depend. The two older sons agree to their father’s terms and swear loyalty to him and to each other. But when the youngest argues that by dividing the lands, Hidetora is creating conditions that will lead to disaster, his father sends him into exile. At the same time, the wife (Mieko Harada, above) of his oldest son — the daughter of a lord conquered by Hidetora — encourages her husband to humiliate his father so he can assume control of the family in his own name. “Though big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, ‘Ran’ has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times.",The New York Times,2013-07-02T05:00:07+0000,article,Culture,Arts,Television,Schedule,nyt://article/6acb981d-ae8f-5f25-aa16-4c761d3048bb,764,nyt://article/6acb981d-ae8f-5f25-aa16-4c761d3048bb,NA,What’s On Tuesday,NA,NA,What’s On Tuesday,NA,NA,NA,By Kathryn Shattuck,NA,518,340,35,C,8

By young, I mean under 70. The Lone Ranger belongs to the ancient pop culture of the Great Depression and the early baby boom. His adventures were heard on radio, starting in the 1930s, and seen on television from 1949 to 1957, but unlike some of his cape-wearing peers, he has mostly stayed in the past, an object of fuzzy nostalgia and mocking incredulity, a symbol of simple pleasures and retrograde attitudes.",The New York Times,2013-07-02T17:30:53+0000,article,Culture,Movies,NA,Review,nyt://article/0545fea7-415e-5c6d-8304-daa06e8033d2,942,nyt://article/0545fea7-415e-5c6d-8304-daa06e8033d2,NA,"Hero Rides Again, With Big Boots to Fill",Movie Review,NA,"Hero Rides Again, With Big Boots to Fill",NA,NA,NA,By A.O.
