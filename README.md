# Thesis Research Presidential Influence

This repository contains data and code for my master's thesis in political science at Appalachian State University. My reseach focuses on the influence Presidents have on the public agenda. In particular I am interested in the influence of public speeches and my research takes the State of the Union address as an example. 

As of now, the project is in a work-in-progress state.
